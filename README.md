#And now i want to talk about the application of While loop.
# In programming, a while loop repeats the execution of the block of code provided, continuously while a given condition evaluates to true. It's usually used when the number of iterations is undetermined and depends on a condition that might change during the execution of the loop.
# 1: Counting with a while loop
# 2: Waiting for User Input
# 3: Infinite Loop (Breaking with a Condition)
"""This kind of loop is useful for creating interactive menus, where the user repeatedly selects options until they choose to exit the program.

Key points:
A while loop is good for cases where you don't know beforehand how many times the loop should run.
It is essential to ensure the loop has a condition to eventually stop (or break out), otherwise, you'll end up with an infinite loop."""
