# This code demonstrates the syntax of a while loop.
# The while loop repeats the code until a condition is met.
# In this case, the code will continue until 'i' becomes greater than or equal to 10.

i = 0
while i < 10:  # The loop runs while 'i' is less than 10.
    print(i + 1)  # Printing i + 1 to get numbers from 1 to 10.
    i += 1  # Incrementing i by 1.

# The expected output is:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
# 10
